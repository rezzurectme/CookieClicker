Gambling version of Cookie Clicker
Title: Cookie Clicker Gambling Edition
Developers: Reza T. Jamalabad, JuanMarco Zamora

Cookie Clickers Gambling Edition's goal is to enhance the gameplay of normal Cookie Clicker with our twists to it. 
In our game, You can play Cookie Clicker the normal way, by just buying towers and clicking the cookie,
but you can also gamble your cookies away in different mini-games to hopefully earn more cookies.

The mini-games include gambling on dice and stocks

The app has a simple interface. the top 2/3 of the screen is where the cookie is, amount of cookies you have, and how many cookies per second you are getting from your different towers in total.
There is a tabs bar that you can scroll to choose what tab you want to be on,
EX: | Towers | Upgrades | ... 

Under the Tab bar, there lays the content of the tab you selected
for example, the towers tab will have the different towers listed with how many you have of each and what the cost to buy 1 is.

I will let players play test beta versions and take notes on balances wanted and test again
